You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Look up the best rated hair dryer on Walmart.\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.5450, 0.1700]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8330, 0.3570]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "1"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/12941723204302730161_3_score.png"}

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Look up the best rated hair dryer on Walmart.\nPrevious Action: \n\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "1"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/12941723204302730161_0.png"}

The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3.

Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Look up the best rated hair dryer on Walmart.\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.5450, 0.1700]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8330, 0.3570]\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8630, 0.3710]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.7920, 0.1410]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "1"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/12941723204302730161_5_score.png"}

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Look up the best rated hair dryer on Walmart.\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.5450, 0.1700]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "1"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/12941723204302730161_1_score.png"}

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels.

For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Look up the best rated hair dryer on Walmart.\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.5450, 0.1700]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8330, 0.3570]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8630, 0.3710]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "1"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/12941723204302730161_4_score.png"}

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Look up the best rated hair dryer on Walmart.\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.5450, 0.1700]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8330, 0.3570]\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8630, 0.3710]\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.7920, 0.1410]\"\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.9060, 0.0690]\"\nstep 7: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.2320, 0.9050]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 8: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1910, 0.4840]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/12941723204302730161_8_score.png"}

The current task screen has prompted the user to perform a verification action (press and hold) to ensure the next steps can be taken. Hence, taking any other action without completing this step will lead to unnecessary deviations.", "critic_input": [{"from": "human", "value": "As an expert in the field of GUI and reinforcement learning, you will receive textual descriptions of history interactions for a given task. You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Look up the best rated hair dryer on Walmart.\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.5450, 0.1700]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8330, 0.3570]\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8630, 0.3710]\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.7920, 0.1410]\"\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.9060, 0.0690]\"\nstep 7: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.2320, 0.9050]\"\nstep 8: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1910, 0.4840]\"\nstep 9: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.4840, 0.1340]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 10: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.4260, 0.1410]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "1"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/12941723204302730161_10_score.png"}

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow.

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Show the shopping cart on newegg.com.\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/8511901440369215944_1.png"}

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Show the shopping cart on newegg.com.\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.5950, 0.3530]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.5040, 0.0610]\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"newegg.com\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8410, 0.1150]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 7: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/8511901440369215944_7.png"}

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Clear all items from cart on walmart.com.\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6840, 0.7870]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8210, 0.0570]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3350, 0.3040]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.9110, 0.1310]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/14578147118064857970_4_score.png"}

Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3.

Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Clear all items from cart on walmart.com.\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6840, 0.7870]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8210, 0.0570]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3350, 0.3040]\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.9110, 0.1310]\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1650, 0.7040]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/14578147118064857970_6.png"}

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Search for a 100 ft extension cord\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6540, 0.7810]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6980, 0.8030]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6960, 0.7990]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/15621786897428313737_2_score.png"}

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Search for a 100 ft extension cord\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6540, 0.7810]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6980, 0.8030]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6960, 0.7990]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6960, 0.7960]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "1"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/15621786897428313737_3_score.png"}

action of typing '100 ft extension cord' into the search box is appropriate. Given the task requirement to search for a 100 ft extension cord, this action leads directly to executing the search query, which is essential for completing the task efficiently.", "critic_input": [{"from": "human", "value": "As an expert in the field of GUI and reinforcement learning, you will receive textual descriptions of history interactions for a given task. You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Search for a 100 ft extension cord\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6540, 0.7810]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6980, 0.8030]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6960, 0.7990]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6960, 0.7960]\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.5840, 0.0690]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"100 ft extension cord\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/15621786897428313737_5.png"}

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Search for a 100 ft extension cord\nPrevious Action: \n\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6540, 0.7810]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/15621786897428313737_0_score.png"}

"human", "value": "As an expert in the field of GUI and reinforcement learning, you will receive textual descriptions of history interactions for a given task. You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Search for a 100 ft extension cord\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6540, 0.7810]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6980, 0.8030]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6960, 0.7990]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6960, 0.7960]\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.5840, 0.0690]\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"100 ft extension cord\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/15621786897428313737_6.png"}

various options for 100 ft extension cords.

Therefore, this action is optimal for efficiently completing the task.", "critic_input": [{"from": "human", "value": "As an expert in the field of GUI and reinforcement learning, you will receive textual descriptions of history interactions for a given task. You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Search for a 100 ft extension cord\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6540, 0.7810]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6980, 0.8030]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6960, 0.7990]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6960, 0.7960]\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.5840, 0.0690]\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"100 ft extension cord\"\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"\"\nstep 7: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3670, 0.3790]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 8: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/15621786897428313737_8.png"}

This aligns well with the task requirement and moves the execution forward efficiently.", "critic_input": [{"from": "human", "value": "As an expert in the field of GUI and reinforcement learning, you will receive textual descriptions of history interactions for a given task. You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Search for a 100 ft extension cord\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6540, 0.7810]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6980, 0.8030]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6960, 0.7990]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6960, 0.7960]\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.5840, 0.0690]\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"100 ft extension cord\"\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"\"\nstep 7: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3670, 0.3790]\"\nstep 8: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 9: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1960, 0.2390]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/15621786897428313737_9_score.png"}

you will receive textual descriptions of history interactions for a given task. You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Search for a 100 ft extension cord\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6540, 0.7810]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6980, 0.8030]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6960, 0.7990]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6960, 0.7960]\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.5840, 0.0690]\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"100 ft extension cord\"\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"\"\nstep 7: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3670, 0.3790]\"\nstep 8: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\nstep 9: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1960, 0.2390]\"\nstep 10: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 11: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8280, 0.5640]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/15621786897428313737_11_score.png"}

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Search for a 100 ft extension cord\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6540, 0.7810]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6980, 0.8030]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6960, 0.7990]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6960, 0.7960]\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.5840, 0.0690]\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"100 ft extension cord\"\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"\"\nstep 7: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3670, 0.3790]\"\nstep 8: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\nstep 9: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1960, 0.2390]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 10: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/15621786897428313737_10.png"}

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow.

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Empty the shopping cart on amazon.\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3110, 0.7530]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "1"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/17830270093301927638_1_score.png"}

If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Empty the shopping cart on amazon.\nPrevious Action: \n\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/17830270093301927638_0.png"}

For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Search for a 100 ft extension cord\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6540, 0.7810]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6980, 0.8030]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6960, 0.7990]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6960, 0.7960]\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.5840, 0.0690]\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"100 ft extension cord\"\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"\"\nstep 7: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3670, 0.3790]\"\nstep 8: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\nstep 9: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1960, 0.2390]\"\nstep 10: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\nstep 11: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8280, 0.5640]\"\nstep 12: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8280, 0.2070]\"\nstep 13: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.9250, 0.1590]\"\nstep 14: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6480, 0.2640]\"\nstep 15: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\nstep 16: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.9560, 0.4180]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 17: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/15621786897428313737_17.png"}

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Search for a 100 ft extension cord\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6540, 0.7810]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6980, 0.8030]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6960, 0.7990]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6960, 0.7960]\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.5840, 0.0690]\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"100 ft extension cord\"\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"\"\nstep 7: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3670, 0.3790]\"\nstep 8: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\nstep 9: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1960, 0.2390]\"\nstep 10: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\nstep 11: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8280, 0.5640]\"\nstep 12: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8280, 0.2070]\"\nstep 13: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.9250, 0.1590]\"\nstep 14: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6480, 0.2640]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 15: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/15621786897428313737_15.png"}

The screenshot clearly shows the desired product, fulfilling the task requirements.", "critic_input": [{"from": "human", "value": "As an expert in the field of GUI and reinforcement learning, you will receive textual descriptions of history interactions for a given task. You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Search for a 100 ft extension cord\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6540, 0.7810]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6980, 0.8030]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6960, 0.7990]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6960, 0.7960]\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.5840, 0.0690]\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"100 ft extension cord\"\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"\"\nstep 7: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3670, 0.3790]\"\nstep 8: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\nstep 9: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1960, 0.2390]\"\nstep 10: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\nstep 11: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8280, 0.5640]\"\nstep 12: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8280, 0.2070]\"\nstep 13: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.9250, 0.1590]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 14: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6480, 0.2640]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/15621786897428313737_14_score.png"}

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3.

Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Empty the shopping cart on amazon.\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3110, 0.7530]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.4640, 0.0930]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.2780, 0.2810]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/17830270093301927638_3_score.png"}

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Empty the shopping cart on amazon.\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3110, 0.7530]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.4640, 0.0930]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "1"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/17830270093301927638_2_score.png"}

This action deviates from the task flow and is not optimal for achieving the task objective.", "critic_input": [{"from": "human", "value": "As an expert in the field of GUI and reinforcement learning, you will receive textual descriptions of history interactions for a given task. You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Search for a 100 ft extension cord\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6540, 0.7810]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6980, 0.8030]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6960, 0.7990]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6960, 0.7960]\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.5840, 0.0690]\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"100 ft extension cord\"\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"\"\nstep 7: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3670, 0.3790]\"\nstep 8: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\nstep 9: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1960, 0.2390]\"\nstep 10: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\nstep 11: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8280, 0.5640]\"\nstep 12: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8280, 0.2070]\"\nstep 13: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.9250, 0.1590]\"\nstep 14: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6480, 0.2640]\"\nstep 15: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 16: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.9560, 0.4180]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "1"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/15621786897428313737_16_score.png"}

Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3.

Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Search for a 100 ft extension cord\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6540, 0.7810]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6980, 0.8030]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6960, 0.7990]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6960, 0.7960]\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.5840, 0.0690]\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"100 ft extension cord\"\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"\"\nstep 7: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3670, 0.3790]\"\nstep 8: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\nstep 9: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1960, 0.2390]\"\nstep 10: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\nstep 11: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8280, 0.5640]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 12: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8280, 0.2070]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "1"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/15621786897428313737_12_score.png"}

For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Empty the shopping cart on amazon.\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3110, 0.7530]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.4640, 0.0930]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.2780, 0.2810]\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.9100, 0.1570]\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.5360, 0.8690]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/17830270093301927638_6.png"}

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3.

Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment.

For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Search for custom wallets on Etsy.\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8810, 0.3710]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.4820, 0.1070]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.9020, 0.0600]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "1"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/14285402145915836608_2_score.png"}

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Search for custom wallets on Etsy.\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8810, 0.3710]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.4820, 0.1070]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.9020, 0.0600]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3880, 0.0540]\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"custom wallets on Etsy \"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3740, 0.1230]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/14285402145915836608_5_score.png"}

Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Search for custom wallets on Etsy.\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8810, 0.3710]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.4820, 0.1070]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.9020, 0.0600]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3880, 0.0540]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"custom wallets on Etsy \"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "1"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/14285402145915836608_4.png"}

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Search for custom wallets on Etsy.\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8810, 0.3710]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.4820, 0.1070]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "1"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/14285402145915836608_1_score.png"}

Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3.

Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3.

If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Show the shopping cart on newegg.\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3300, 0.7510]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3460, 0.0820]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "1"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/8337651141740723714_1_score.png"}

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Search for the best way to get rid of a cold\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1380, 0.5980]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6870, 0.1120]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.9180, 0.0700]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3710, 0.0760]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "1"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/10348819711154626066_3_score.png"}

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Search for the best way to get rid of a cold\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1380, 0.5980]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6870, 0.1120]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.9180, 0.0700]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "1"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/10348819711154626066_2_score.png"}

Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Show the shopping cart on newegg.\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3300, 0.7510]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3460, 0.0820]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.2220, 0.3640]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8290, 0.1610]\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8480, 0.1590]\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8480, 0.1590]\"\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8480, 0.1590]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 7: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/8337651141740723714_7.png"}

Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text.

Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment.

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Search for the best way to get rid of a cold\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1380, 0.5980]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6870, 0.1120]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.9180, 0.0700]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3710, 0.0760]\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3710, 0.0720]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \" the best way to get rid of a cold \"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "1"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/10348819711154626066_5.png"}

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Search for the best way to get rid of a cold\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1380, 0.5980]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6870, 0.1120]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.9180, 0.0700]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3710, 0.0760]\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3710, 0.0720]\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \" the best way to get rid of a cold \"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3120, 0.1380]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "1"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/10348819711154626066_6_score.png"}

appropriate in this situation as it will likely show more search results or lead to more relevant information about how to get rid of a cold. This can help in finding the best way to accomplish the given task by exploring all available options.", "critic_input": [{"from": "human", "value": "As an expert in the field of GUI and reinforcement learning, you will receive textual descriptions of history interactions for a given task. You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Search for the best way to get rid of a cold\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1380, 0.5980]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6870, 0.1120]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.9180, 0.0700]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3710, 0.0760]\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3710, 0.0720]\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \" the best way to get rid of a cold \"\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3120, 0.1380]\"\nstep 7: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 8: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/10348819711154626066_8.png"}

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Search for the best way to get rid of a cold\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1380, 0.5980]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6870, 0.1120]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.9180, 0.0700]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3710, 0.0760]\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3710, 0.0720]\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \" the best way to get rid of a cold \"\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3120, 0.1380]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 7: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/10348819711154626066_7.png"}

Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Search for the best way to get rid of a cold\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1380, 0.5980]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6870, 0.1120]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.9180, 0.0700]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3710, 0.0760]\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3710, 0.0720]\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \" the best way to get rid of a cold \"\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3120, 0.1380]\"\nstep 7: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\nstep 8: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 9: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.2090, 0.3210]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/10348819711154626066_9_score.png"}

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Clear all items from cart on walmart.com.\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6880, 0.7870]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3490, 0.0720]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"walmart.com\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.2150, 0.1310]\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.9220, 0.1340]\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.9580, 0.7320]\"\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.4250, 0.7770]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 7: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.9440, 0.6220]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "1"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/10103093331929811105_7_score.png"}

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Clear all items from cart on walmart.com.\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6880, 0.7870]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3490, 0.0720]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"walmart.com\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.2150, 0.1310]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.9220, 0.1340]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/10103093331929811105_4_score.png"}

Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment.

Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Add apple airpods to the cart on ebay\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.7070, 0.7920]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/667669866302657337_1_score.png"}

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Clear all items from cart on walmart.com.\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6880, 0.7870]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3490, 0.0720]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"walmart.com\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.2150, 0.1310]\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.9220, 0.1340]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.9580, 0.7320]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/10103093331929811105_5_score.png"}

If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text.

Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment.

If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Add apple airpods to the cart on ebay\nPrevious Action: \n\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/667669866302657337_0.png"}

Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Add apple airpods to the cart on ebay\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.7070, 0.7920]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3250, 0.0470]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"ebay\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/667669866302657337_3.png"}

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels.

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Add apple airpods to the cart on ebay\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.7070, 0.7920]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3250, 0.0470]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"ebay\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/667669866302657337_4.png"}

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Add apple airpods to the cart on ebay\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.7070, 0.7920]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3250, 0.0470]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"ebay\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.2300, 0.1800]\"\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.2910, 0.3260]\"\nstep 7: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1430, 0.1630]\"\nstep 8: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"apple airpods\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 9: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/667669866302657337_9.png"}

This action allows the user to perform a search and find the desired item.", "critic_input": [{"from": "human", "value": "As an expert in the field of GUI and reinforcement learning, you will receive textual descriptions of history interactions for a given task. You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Add apple airpods to the cart on ebay\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.7070, 0.7920]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3250, 0.0470]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"ebay\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.2300, 0.1800]\"\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.2910, 0.3260]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 7: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1430, 0.1630]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/667669866302657337_7_score.png"}

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Add apple airpods to the cart on ebay\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.7070, 0.7920]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3250, 0.0470]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"ebay\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.2300, 0.1800]\"\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.2910, 0.3260]\"\nstep 7: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1430, 0.1630]\"\nstep 8: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"apple airpods\"\nstep 9: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 10: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1850, 0.4560]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/667669866302657337_10_score.png"}

This step directs towards selecting the desired product, which is a key part of the task flow.", "critic_input": [{"from": "human", "value": "As an expert in the field of GUI and reinforcement learning, you will receive textual descriptions of history interactions for a given task. You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Add apple airpods to the cart on ebay\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.7070, 0.7920]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3250, 0.0470]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"ebay\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.2300, 0.1800]\"\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.2910, 0.3260]\"\nstep 7: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1430, 0.1630]\"\nstep 8: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"apple airpods\"\nstep 9: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"\"\nstep 10: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1850, 0.4560]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 11: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6480, 0.6270]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/667669866302657337_11_score.png"}

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Add apple airpods to the cart on ebay\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.7070, 0.7920]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3250, 0.0470]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"ebay\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.2300, 0.1800]\"\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.2910, 0.3260]\"\nstep 7: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1430, 0.1630]\"\nstep 8: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"apple airpods\"\nstep 9: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"\"\nstep 10: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1850, 0.4560]\"\nstep 11: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6480, 0.6270]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 12: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/667669866302657337_12.png"}

Therefore, declaring 'STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE' is the optimal action to indicate task completion.", "critic_input": [{"from": "human", "value": "As an expert in the field of GUI and reinforcement learning, you will receive textual descriptions of history interactions for a given task. You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Add apple airpods to the cart on ebay\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.7070, 0.7920]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3250, 0.0470]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"ebay\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.2300, 0.1800]\"\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.2910, 0.3260]\"\nstep 7: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1430, 0.1630]\"\nstep 8: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"apple airpods\"\nstep 9: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"\"\nstep 10: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1850, 0.4560]\"\nstep 11: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6480, 0.6270]\"\nstep 12: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\nstep 13: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.4880, 0.6050]\"\nstep 14: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.4630, 0.5960]\"\nstep 15: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\nstep 16: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3460, 0.5390]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 17: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/667669866302657337_17.png"}

AirPods in the shopping cart, fulfilling the task requirement.", "critic_input": [{"from": "human", "value": "As an expert in the field of GUI and reinforcement learning, you will receive textual descriptions of history interactions for a given task. You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Add apple airpods to the cart on ebay\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.7070, 0.7920]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3250, 0.0470]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"ebay\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.2300, 0.1800]\"\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.2910, 0.3260]\"\nstep 7: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1430, 0.1630]\"\nstep 8: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"apple airpods\"\nstep 9: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"\"\nstep 10: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1850, 0.4560]\"\nstep 11: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6480, 0.6270]\"\nstep 12: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\nstep 13: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.4880, 0.6050]\"\nstep 14: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.4630, 0.5960]\"\nstep 15: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 16: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3460, 0.5390]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/667669866302657337_16_score.png"}

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Add apple airpods to the cart on ebay\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.7070, 0.7920]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3250, 0.0470]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"ebay\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.2300, 0.1800]\"\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.2910, 0.3260]\"\nstep 7: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1430, 0.1630]\"\nstep 8: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"apple airpods\"\nstep 9: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"\"\nstep 10: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1850, 0.4560]\"\nstep 11: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6480, 0.6270]\"\nstep 12: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 13: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.4880, 0.6050]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/667669866302657337_13_score.png"}

announcing task completion at this moment is appropriate. The screenshot shows that 'Apple AirPods Pro' have been successfully added to the shopping cart on eBay, which aligns perfectly with the task requirement of adding apple airpods to the cart.", "critic_input": [{"from": "human", "value": "As an expert in the field of GUI and reinforcement learning, you will receive textual descriptions of history interactions for a given task. You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Add apple airpods to the cart on ebay\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.7070, 0.7920]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3250, 0.0470]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"ebay\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.2300, 0.1800]\"\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.2910, 0.3260]\"\nstep 7: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1430, 0.1630]\"\nstep 8: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"apple airpods\"\nstep 9: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"\"\nstep 10: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1850, 0.4560]\"\nstep 11: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6480, 0.6270]\"\nstep 12: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\nstep 13: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.4880, 0.6050]\"\nstep 14: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.4630, 0.5960]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 15: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/667669866302657337_15.png"}

Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment.

Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Search for the new Jordans on Nike.com\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6220, 0.7220]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8020, 0.1040]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.0950, 0.0950]\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.4100, 0.4340]\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"nike.com\"\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3980, 0.1860]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 7: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.7580, 0.1930]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "1"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/16839136254108124831_7_score.png"}

This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Search for the new Jordans on Nike.com\nPrevious Action: \n\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/16839136254108124831_0.png"}

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3.

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Search for the new Jordans on Nike.com\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6220, 0.7220]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8020, 0.1040]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.0950, 0.0950]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.4100, 0.4340]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/16839136254108124831_4_score.png"}

It serves as the necessary step to access the web browser in order to navigate to Nike.com and search for the new Jordans, aligning well with the task requirement.", "critic_input": [{"from": "human", "value": "As an expert in the field of GUI and reinforcement learning, you will receive textual descriptions of history interactions for a given task. You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Search for the new Jordans on Nike.com\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6220, 0.7220]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/16839136254108124831_1_score.png"}

Since a search term has not been typed yet and is the focus of previous interactions, repeating the double-click action at this moment doesn't contribute to progressing the task, leading to potential deviations from the task flow of searching for 'new Jordans' on Nike.com.", "critic_input": [{"from": "human", "value": "As an expert in the field of GUI and reinforcement learning, you will receive textual descriptions of history interactions for a given task. You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Search for the new Jordans on Nike.com\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6220, 0.7220]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8020, 0.1040]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.0950, 0.0950]\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.4100, 0.4340]\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"nike.com\"\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3980, 0.1860]\"\nstep 7: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.7580, 0.1930]\"\nstep 8: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.5650, 0.1910]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 9: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.5650, 0.1910]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "1"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/16839136254108124831_9_score.png"}

searching for new Jordans on Nike.com. Instead, selecting the 'Jordan' option under popular search terms would directly lead to the required category, promoting task efficiency.", "critic_input": [{"from": "human", "value": "As an expert in the field of GUI and reinforcement learning, you will receive textual descriptions of history interactions for a given task. You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Search for the new Jordans on Nike.com\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6220, 0.7220]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8020, 0.1040]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.0950, 0.0950]\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.4100, 0.4340]\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"nike.com\"\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3980, 0.1860]\"\nstep 7: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.7580, 0.1930]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 8: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.5650, 0.1910]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "1"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/16839136254108124831_8_score.png"}

You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow. For example:\n      (1) Incorrect text input.\n      (2) Clicking a button that might lead to an advertisement.\n      (3) Announcing the task's success when it has not actually been achieved.\n   Level 2: The action is the optimal and correct choice for completing the task at this moment. For example:\n      (1) When showing task completion, the displayed content can fully achieve it.\n      (2) When entering an unrelated interface, you can return to the main screen by executing \"PRESS_HOME.\"\n      (3) Selecting the most correct entry point to complete the current task.\n\n## Output requirements: 1 or 2 (INT)\n\n## Example Input:\nTask Requirements: What is the capital of England?\nPrevious Action:\nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.524, 0.06]\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot:\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n\n## Example Output:\n2\n\nTask Requirements: Search for the new Jordans on Nike.com\nPrevious Action: \nstep 0: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\nstep 1: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.6220, 0.7220]\"\nstep 2: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.8020, 0.1040]\"\nstep 3: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.0950, 0.0950]\"\nstep 4: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.4100, 0.4340]\"\nstep 5: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"nike.com\"\nstep 6: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.3980, 0.1860]\"\nstep 7: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.7580, 0.1930]\"\nstep 8: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.5650, 0.1910]\"\nstep 9: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.5650, 0.1910]\"\nstep 10: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.2480, 0.4610]\"\nstep 11: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.7950, 0.6270]\"\nCurrent Action and Screenshot: \n<image>\nstep 12: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": \"[0.1770, 0.4510]\"\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "2"}], "critic_image": "images/aitw_images/webshopping/16839136254108124831_12_score.png"}

to the correct section of the Nike website. The displayed content confirms that we have reached the Jordan section which fulfills the task goal.", "critic_input": [{"from": "human", "value": "As an expert in the field of GUI and reinforcement learning, you will receive textual descriptions of history interactions for a given task. You need to evaluate the current action, similar to what a value function does in reinforcement learning. Detailed criteria and standards are given below.\n\n## Explanation of the input content:\n1. Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3. The current action to be evaluated and the corresponding screenshot(the screenshot before each operation. If the operation is of the \"DUAL_POINT\" type, the click position is marked with a red dot in the image.)\n\n## Evaluation Criteria:\nHere are the detailed descriptions of the two levels. Attention needs to be paid to whether the action taken based on the current screenshot promotes efficient task execution, rather than the relevance of the content shown in the current screenshot to the task:\n   Level 1: The action is not the optimal choice for completing the task at this moment, which may lead to deviations from the task flow.

Task: Brief description of the current GUI task, such as implementing the \"Get Hong Kong hotel prices\" task in Android GUI.\n2. Description of History operation\n   Contains 11 types of GUI operations. Specific fields and their meanings are as follows:\n   [1] DUAL_POINT: Double-click on a specific position on the screen. If it is a link or software, it will enter; if it is text, it will be selected. The \"click_point\" is represented by a two-dimensional array indicating the position of the click, relative to the top-left corner of the screenshot and within a range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"DUAL_POINT\", \"click_point\": [0.5, 0.5]\n   [2] TYPE: An action type that sends text. Note that this simply sends text and does not perform any clicks for element focus or enter presses for submitting text.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"TYPE\", \"typed_text\": \"capital of England\"\n   [3] PRESS_BACK: Return to the previous page. Usually the previous webpage.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_BACK\"\n   [4] PRESS_HOME: Return to the system home page. Use this action to return to the home screen when the current screen is not the desired one, so you can reselect the program you need to enter.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_HOME\"\n   [5] PRESS_ENTER: Press the enter key to execute a step. Generally, after confirming the input text, use this action to start the search.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"PRESS_ENTER\"\n   [6] STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE: An action used to indicate that the desired task has been completed and resets the environment. This action should also be used if the task is already completed and there is nothing more to do. For example, the task is to turn on the Wi-Fi when it is already on.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_COMPLETE\"\n   [7] STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE: An action used to indicate that the desired task is impossible to complete and resets the environment. This can result from various reasons including UI changes, Android version differences, etc.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"STATUS_TASK_IMPOSSIBLE\"\n   [8] SCROLL_DOWN: Scroll down.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_DOWN\"\n   [9] SCROLL_UP: Scroll up.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_UP\"\n   [10] SCROLL_LEFT: Scroll left.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_LEFT\"\n   [11] SCROLL_RIGHT: Scroll right.\n      - example: \"action_type\": \"SCROLL_RIGHT\"\n3.
